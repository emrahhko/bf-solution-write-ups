```js
const societyName = (friends) => friends.sort().map(name => name[0].toUpperCase()).join('');
```

## Strategy

The user's strategy regarding this is to create an arrow function
named societyName that takes an array of friend names (friends) as its parameter,
and using different built in method to return string with first letter of each of
 their names, sorted in alphabetical order, which represents the name of their
 Secret Society.

## Implementation

The user wrote a one line implementation of his strategy that uses different 
built in method;

**sort()** method Sort the array of friend names alphabetically.

**map()** method is used to transform each name in the sorted array by extracting
the first character of each name and converting it to uppercase.

**join('')** method is used to concatenate all the transformed 
first characters into a single string.

**Arrow function - implicit return**: user's solution is a single expression
so he didn't need a `return` statement.

## Possible Refactors

No is already quite clear and concise, it could be implemented

- a longer `for` loop

## References

This solution was interesting to me because the user didn't use any loop
but instead used a **map** method making the process a lot easier compared to mine.
